# 👋 Hi, I'm Anthony

**Software Developer** with 3+ years of experience building **mobile and web applications** in enterprise and product-driven environments.

I specialize in **Flutter and frontend development**, with solid experience integrating APIs and applying **Clean Architecture** and **design patterns** to deliver scalable, maintainable, and business-oriented solutions.

I have worked on projects for **enterprise clients such as HPE**, developing reusable UI components, optimizing application performance, and collaborating with cross-functional teams.

I also have hands-on experience with **backend development in Java**, **CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions**, and **unit testing** to ensure code reliability.
